**This is DataMind - A Web Platform to Enhance Data Interpretability of Training Data through DataSheet Sharing**

1) Please git clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/williamdjting/419project.git
```

3) Install all npm packages, ensure your node is up to date (NextJS requires an up to date version)
```bash
npm i
```
```bash
nvm install node
```

6) Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

4) Navigate to http://localhost:3000/projects with your browser to see the result. localhost:3000 is not used.

5) Interact with the platform locally. Add entries, it is functional. Deleting entries does not exist. Note, some data is hardcoded from the CSV.
